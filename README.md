# DECODING MORSE-CODE

In this Project we are asked to decode a string with MORSE-CODE using Ruby Programming language.
We wrote several functions to perform these tasks.

## Getting Started

. [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

To get a local copy up and running, download the zip file or follow the steps below by running these commands in your command line.

```bash
git clone https@github.com/ogagaoghene/vet-clinc-postgresql.git
```

Navigate to the folder in your machine:

```bash
cd vet-clinic-postgresql
```

- For Windows users, Run the following commands in your terminal

1. Login to postgres with your password
2. create your database `createdb <databeName>` from the psql terminal program or pg4admin web application
3. Open the postgres psql terminal program `psql`, to connect you to the prompt as
   `postgres=#

````
4. Connect to your database.
    ```
    postgres=# \c <databaseName>

    ```
5. From here you can create tables and manipulate the database.
